# morph-svg-JS
A javascript animated svg component created with anime.js 

I created some svg's with Figma and used the map data within the files to create a morph animation with anime.js.

i am by no means an expert with svg's but this plugin makes it extremely easy to manipulate images. 

feel free to use it in your own work.
